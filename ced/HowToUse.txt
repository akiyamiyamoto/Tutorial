CED is an event viewer of ILCSoft data based on X11 and OpenGL.
CED consistes of a display server, glced, and a client, ced-viewer. 

glced has to be executed in advance. ced-viewer is a Marlin
application and sends display data to glced through tcp port defined by 
CED_PORT environment parameter.  glced can run at a remote site where
ced-viewer runs or at your local PC.  

The sample programs here are to run glced and ced-viewer both at KEKCC.
To run them, do 

  1. The first step is to run glced, using a script start-glced,
     which sets CED_PORT to your uid in order to avoid a conflict 
     with other users, then start glced and the glced window will open.

  2. The next step is to run CEDViewer process by Marlin by a script runced,
     the first argument being as the input data.  The runced script is 
     prepared to display REC file.  The steering file has to be modified 
     to display DST data. 

     The CEDViewer can be terminated by <CTRL>-C or at the end of input file.
     The glced can stay running for use by another CEDViewer job.

   In short, do 
    $ ./glced-start
    $ ./runced [rec-file]


If glced is installed in your local PC, it can be executed at your PC
and receive display command from CED viewer running at KEKCC. 
The following line should be inserted in the ssh configuration file, 
~/.ssh/config, in order to allow port forwarding.


--- begining of ~/.ssh/config 

   Host *.cc.kek.jp
      FallBackToRsh no
      RemoteForward <CED_PORT>  localhost:<CED_PORT>

--- end of ~/.ssh/config

<CED_PORT> is the <CED_PORT> number which is used by glced and ced-viewer.
