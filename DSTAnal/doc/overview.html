<h2>Overview</h2>

This processor analize LOI DST of ILD and create a root ntuple.
Assuming an analysis of n1N1H and n1N1qQ, the produced ntuple contains 
following variables.<br>
<pre>
  ev    : visible energy
  vm    : visible mass
  jcs1  : costh of first jet
  jcs2  : costh of second jet
  btag  : sum of btags of 1st and 2nd jets
  ctag  : sum of ctags of 1st and 2nd jets
  bctag : sum of bctags of 1st and 2nd jets
</pre>
