/**

\mainpage DSTAnalysis : ilcsoft sample program 

<h2>Overview</h2>

This directory contains an example to run MarlinFastJet on 
ILD DBD DST file and create a root file of visible mass, 
jet mass etc by a user program.

The source code is src/MyDSTProcessor.cc
An example to access LCIO object and create a root Ntuple 
will be found there.

To build the program,  

<pre>
$ . /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc49_sl6/v02-00-01/init_ilcsoft.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -C ${ILCSOFT}/ILCSoft.cmake ..
$ make 
$ make install
</pre>

To run interactively, 
<pre>
$ cd run 
$ ./rundst.sh 
</pre>

This will analize sample created by runmarlin example of Tutorial.
A file, myanal.root, is created in the current directory.

To analize the ILD optimization sample at KEKCC, do 
<pre>
$ . bsub.sh 
</pre>

This will submit a batch job and creates a file, anal_many.root

The root file contains a ntuple named "nt", which has following leaves.
<pre>
1. Variables calculated by all PandoraPFOs objects
  ev   : visible energy
  np   : number of particles
  mass : visible mass

2. Variables calculated using MarlinFastJet result.
  nj   : Number of jets
  jm   : Mass of 2-jet system
  csj  : CosTheta of 2-jet system
  csj1 : CosTheta of 1st jet
  csj2 : CosTheta of 2nd jet.
</pre>

Note that input file include aa_lowpt background tracks and 
options and parameters are not optimized for the best result.
It is prepared as an example.
