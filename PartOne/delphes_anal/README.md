# delphes_anal.py

An example to analyse Delphes files.
Files created at a lecture on Delphes fast simulation, 
[https://kds.kek.jp/event/37644/timetable](https://kds.kek.jp/event/37644/timetable/)
are used as inputs and PFOs collections are analized similary as e2e2anal.

Before executing the example, symbolic links to the delphes files created by 
R.Yonamine's lecture should be created in this directory, renaming file names
properly.  This is done by ```create_link.sh```

Then do ```python delphes_anal.py``` to run analysis.  Files like ```plot.png``` and ```plot.pdf``` 
are created.
