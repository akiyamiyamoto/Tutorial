\mainpage MCMarlin : ilcsoft sample program 

<h2>Overview</h2>

This directory contains an example to run a program 
to analize MCParticle collection of LCIO file. 
For study of mu+ mu- h events, recoil mass respect to mu+ mu- system,
etc are calcualated and saved in a root file.

The source code is src/MCMarlin.cc
An example to access LCIO object and create a root Ntuple 
will be found there.

To build the program,  

<pre>
$ . /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc82_centos7/v02-02-01/init_ilcsoft.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -C ${ILCSOFT}/ILCSoft.cmake ..
$ make 
$ make install
</pre>

To run interactively, 
<pre>
$ cd run 
$ ./run.sh 
</pre>

This will analize mu+ mu- h sample in ~/Tutorial/data.
A file, mcmarlin.root, is created.

To run in batch at KEKCC, do 
<pre>
$ . bsub.sh 
</pre>


This will submit a batch job and creates a file.

The root file contains a ntuple named "nt", which has following leaves.
<pre>
1. Variables calculated from MCParticle objects
  emum  : selected mu- energy
  emup  : selected mu+ energy
  mmumu : mu+mu- mass
  mrecoil : mass recoil to the mu+ mu- system
  mrest  : observed mass excluding mu+ mu- 

</pre>
